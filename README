Hi all! This is the first public version of Pitchfork. 
Try it out - let me know what you think. Yes, it's a 
little messy, there are some things I did wrong and 
it hasn't really been through the formal design process
but if you find it useful - consider helping extend it.

I can't be bothered with all that licensing stuff, 
basically whatever you want to do with it, that's fine.
However I should point out that the Pitchfork logo is
copywritten to me (so you should not use it to promote
your own services without my permission) and you should
distribute the source code with it (which in practical
terms means posting a link to this repository for your
user to follow.)

On to installation information - Pitchfork needs
essentially three things: 1) A place for the PHP 
scripts to go; 2) A place for the files you're serving
to go and 3) A "secret" directory of your choosing
(preferably not accessible to the web) to store things.
I recommend that if you want to use the "Compressed
Download" option that you should install the zip command
line program. Ooh, and don't forget to make your secret
directory writeable (this has stung me in the tail,
producing zip files that are filled with errors.) 
Once you have these things, simply modify the 
pitchfork-configuration-user.php file in the
configuration directory, and you'll be good to go.
Oh yes, and you will probably need to allow PHP to 
execute shell commands.

Pitchfork does not run on Windows (as the command 
line is different - you might be able to get it
running under Cygwin or something) and is quite
sensitive to the distribution that you're using
(it has been tested on run on OpenSUSE). If 
something doesn't work - by all means tell me about
it and I'll see what I can do. 

Happy serving :)
